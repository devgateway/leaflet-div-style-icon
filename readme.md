Styleable Leaflet DivIcons
==========================

Divicons for rectangles and circles that can be passed svg-like style rules



Ideally it will be something like:

```javascript
var icon = L.circleDivIcon({
  color: 'red'
});
```

where the object passed to the constructor is just like any style hash you give to the leaflet svg layers.
